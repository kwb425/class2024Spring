        "\n",
        "Conditional statements in Python allow you to test a condition and perform different actions depending on whether the condition is `True` or `False`.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Syntax:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "if condition:\n",
        "    # execute this block of code\n",
        "elif another_condition:\n",
        "    # execute this block of code\n",
        "else:\n",
        "    # if none of the above conditions are true, execute this block\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "x = 10\n",
        "if x < 5:\n",
        "    print(\"x is less than 5\")\n",
        "elif x == 5:\n",
        "    print(\"x is 5\")\n",
        "else:\n",
        "    print(\"x is greater than 5\")\n",

        "## 2. Looping Structures (for and while loops)\n",
        "\n",
        "Loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code. Python provides two primary looping structures: `for` and `while`.\n",
        "\n",
        "**For Loop:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "for item in sequence:\n",
        "    # execute this block of code for each item in the sequence\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
        "for fruit in fruits:\n",
        "    print(fruit)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**While Loop:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "while condition:\n",
        "    # execute this block of code as long as the condition is true\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "count = 0\n",
        "while count < 5:\n",
        "    print(count)\n",
        "    count += 1\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. Functions and their parameters\n",
        "\n",
        "A function is a block of code that only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. A function can return data as a result.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Syntax:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def function_name(parameters):\n",
        "    # block of code\n",
        "    return result\n",
        "```\n",

        "\n",
        "* **Parameters** are the names listed in the function's definition.\n",
        "* **Arguments** are the values sent to the function when it is called.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4. Scope and Variable Visibility\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, a variable's scope determines where you can access that variable. There are two main types of scopes:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Local Scope:** A variable declared inside a function has a local scope and is only accessible inside that function.\n",
        "* **Global Scope:** A variable declared outside any function has a global scope and is accessible from any function in the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# This is a global variable\n",
        "x = 10\n",
        "\n",
        "def my_function():\n",
        "    # This is a local variable\n",
        "    y = 5\n",
        "    print(x)  # This will print 10 (global variable)\n",
        "    print(y)  # This will print 5 (local variable)\n",
        "\n",
        "my_function()\n",
        "\n",
        "# print(y)  # This will cause an error because y is not accessible outside the function\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note:** You can use the `global` keyword to modify a global variable from inside a function.\n"
